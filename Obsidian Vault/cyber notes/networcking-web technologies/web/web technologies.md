## 🌐 1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

HTTP is the protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate.

### 🔹 Example:

When you visit `http://example.com`, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server at `example.com` asking for a web page.

### 🔹 HTTPS and HTTP Methods (also called "verbs"):

- `GET`: Retrieve data
    
- `POST`: Submit data
    
- `PUT`: Update data
    
- `DELETE`: Delete data
    
- `HEAD`: Like GET, but returns headers only
    
- `OPTIONS`: Show available methods
    
- `PATCH`: Partially update data
